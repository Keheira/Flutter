# Flutter Demos

This repo holds all my code from taking [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

I decided to take this course because Flutter is coming up in a lot of conversations at work. Also I have a few small personal projects like I'd like to build out quickly without having to manage 2 code bases. This seemed like a fun solution over RN.

I recommend getting this course vs just coping my code. I'll probably add more than just the demo projects to this repo as time goes on but there is no garuntee of that.
